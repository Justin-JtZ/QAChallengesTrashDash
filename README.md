# QAChallengesTrashDash

**To Start Game**
Game was run on Unity Version 2020.3.20f1.
I recommend downloading the same version to ensure compatibility.
Launch the game through Unity Hub by selecting the Trash Dash folder.
If not seen, be sure to select **Add** and navigate to the folder where the game has been downloaded.
In the **Project** tab in the bottom left window, navigate to the **Scenes** Folder and select the **Main** scene.
From there, press the Play button at the top of the screen and this should then launch the game.


**To Find PDF:**

File path is as such: TrashDash>Assets>TestCases
